# Coins with different denominations like 1¢, 5¢ and 10¢ are given.
#  Identify a solution to make an amount by using these coins such that a minimum number of coins are used. Explain the algorithm in detail 

# Create a python function to compute the fewest number of 
# coins that we need to make up the amount given for coin change problem using dynamic programming
